# Traffic Flow and Urban Planning

Why? 
Testing changes to traffic flow, road design, or signal timing in the real world would disrupt daily life, cause potential accidents, and require significant time and costs. Simulation allows for testing different traffic scenarios, peak hours, and road layouts without impacting actual road users. It also helps urban planners analyze long-term effects, like how a new highway could influence surrounding neighborhoods or environmental noise.

Regarding the sustainability aspects: Simulations could optimize traffic flow to reduce idle time and emissions, encourage public transport efficiency, or support bike-friendly and pedestrian-friendly planning. Analyzing potential reductions in carbon footprint and noise pollution can guide sustainable urban development.
