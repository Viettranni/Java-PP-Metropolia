# Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event? 
By generating new arrival events, the simulation keeps an ongoing process of arrivals that mimics the steady or random flow of arrivals in an operational system. 

# Which event should be generated by the start of the service? 
The start of the service should generate an end-of-service event, which signals when the service for a particular customer is expected to complete.
