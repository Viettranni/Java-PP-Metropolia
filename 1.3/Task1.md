To generate 1,000 age values based on the group's age distribution:

Create an Age Distribution Table: Define a table that links each age to a cumulative percentage (e.g., ages 20, 21, etc., with cumulative cutoff values up to 100%).

Generate Random Numbers: Create 1,000 random numbers between 1 and 100. Each number will act as a "percentage" to decide the age.

Map Numbers to Ages: For each random number, check the age distribution table. Assign an age based on the range it falls into (e.g., if a random number is 17, and 17 falls under the 21-year-old category, assign age 21).
